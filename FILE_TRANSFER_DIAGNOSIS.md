# File Transfer Diagnostic Guide

## 🔍 Current Analysis

Based on the logs you shared, we identified the following issues:

### 1. Group-chat file transfer fails

**Symptom:**

```
[File Transfer] Starting to send file to broadcast (localhost/127.0.0.1:9081)
The group chat UI shows “file send failed”
```

**Possible causes:**

* The address still uses the complex form `localhost/127.0.0.1:9081`.
* The program fails during address parsing and never prints the subsequent debug messages.

### 2. Private-chat file transfer issue

**Symptom:**

```
Accepted file transfer: c60e2645-260f-4281-94b1-c90262b7a7c0.png from a60b654c...
After accepting a private-chat file, no downloaded file is found
```

**Analysis:** The file-transfer request was accepted, but the actual data transfer did not complete.

## 🚀 Resolution

### Step 1: Update to the latest version

```bash
git pull origin main
mvn clean compile
```

### Step 2: Restart the nodes and watch the detailed logs

After updating, you should see more verbose diagnostics like:

```
[File Transfer] Start processing file send request
[File Transfer] Target node ID: broadcast
[File Transfer] File: filename.png (12345 bytes)
[File Transfer] Save path: filename.png
[File Transfer] Broadcast mode, current connection count: 1
[File Transfer] Broadcast mode, chosen connection: localhost/127.0.0.1:9081
[File Transfer] Connected remote node ID: 132f9b62...
[File Transfer] Original address: localhost/127.0.0.1:9081, normalized address: 127.0.0.1:9081
[File Transfer] Parse result — host: 127.0.0.1, base port: 9081, file-transfer port: 10081
[File Transfer] Preparing to connect to: 127.0.0.1:10081
[File Transfer] Sending header: SEND:transfer_xxx:filename.png:12345:filename.png
[File Transfer] File sent: filename.png (12345 bytes)
```

### Step 3: Check the save location

By default, files are saved to the program’s working directory. Check:

* Windows: `C:\Users\lenovo\Downloads\P2pChat-main\P2pChat-main\`
* Or the exact path printed by the program

### Step 4: If problems persist

If the issue remains after updating, please provide full debug logs, including:

1. Complete logs from the sender
2. Complete logs from the receiver
3. Any error messages

## 🔧 Temporary Workarounds

If you can’t update immediately, try:

1. Restart both nodes
2. Ensure the nodes are fully connected before attempting the transfer
3. Test with a smaller file (e.g., a text file)

## 📋 Expected Outcome

After the fix, file transfer should:

1. Print full debug information
2. Establish the connection successfully
3. Show transfer progress
4. Save the file on the receiver side
5. Display a “transfer completed” message

Please update, test again, and share the new logs for further diagnosis if needed.
